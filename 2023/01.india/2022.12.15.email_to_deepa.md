# email to Deepa

Hello Deepa and Ranjeet!

I hope you are well today.  We've been booking our stays, finding hostels, doing all the things as quickly as we can 🤪 😂.

We've decided we definitely want to do this -- to have a driver, as specified in the itinerary.  We'd like to choose the Toyota Etios option.

We're undecided regarding what tours we'd like to do.  How far in advance do we need to decide whether we will do a tour?  I obviously understand that there is coordination required to make something like that happen,  but right now we're figuring out where we'll be sleeping, which is more essential.

I should mention again that we'll be traveling as a group of 3.  One of Brittany's best friends will join us for the whole trip!

I'd like to ask for some help booking flights and trains.  I tried to do this myself, but my credit card was declined.  I did some research online, and it seems I need to register at IRCTC before I can book anything.  I've also read the advice, "Just have the people who work wherever you are staying book that for you."  What's your advice for this?

The flights and trains we will need to book are:

1. Flight from Mumbai to Jaisalmer __05 Jan__ (it looks like there's a non-stop flight at 14:15)
2. Train from Jaisalmer to Jodhpur __08 Jan__ (`15013 RANIKHET EXP JSM 03.00 8-01`)
3. Train from Delhi to Hardiwar __29 Jan__
4. We'll need to find a way to get from Rishikesh to Dehradun, because we're flying from Dehradun to Mumbai __02 Feb__
5. Flight from Dehradun to Mumbai __02 Feb__ (`Vistara UK 865 15:10 Dehradun 02 h 25 m Non stop 17:35 Mumbai`)

Are you able / willing to help us and book these for us?  For each of these, we'll be booking for 3 adults.

I think that's the full update for now.  Please let me know what the next steps are, as far as payment, deciding on tours, etc., goes.

Thank you so much for your help in bringing this trip into being!  Your help has been such a gift -- we are more excited than ever to be visiting India!

Blessings,

Caleb
